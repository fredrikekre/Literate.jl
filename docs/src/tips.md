# [**7.** Tips and tricks](@id tips-and-tricks)

This section lists some tips and tricks that might be useful for using
Literate.

### [Filesize of generated notebooks](@id notebook-filesize)

When Literate executes a notebook the return value, i.e. the result of the
last Julia expression in each cell is captured. By default Literate generates
multiple renderings of the result in different output formats or
[MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME)s, just like
[IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) does. All of these renderings
are embedded in the notebook and it is up to the notebook frontend viewer to select
the most appropriate format to show to the user.

A common example is images, which can often be displayed in multiple formats, e.g. PNG
(`image/png`), SVG (`image/svg+xml`) and HTML (`text/html`). As a result, the filesize of
the generated notebook can become large.

In order to remedy this you can use the clever Julia package
[`DisplayAs`](https://github.com/tkf/DisplayAs.jl) to limit the output capabilities of
an object. For example, to "force" an image to be captures as `image/png` only,
you can use

```julia
import DisplayAs
img = plot(...)
img = DisplayAs.PNG(img)
```

This can save some memory, since the image is never captured in e.g. SVG or
HTML formats.

!!! note
    It is best to always let the object be showable as `text/plain`. This can be achieved
    by nested calls to `DisplayAs` output types. For example, to limit an image `img` to
    be showable as just `image/png` and `text/plain` you can use
    ```julia
    img = plot(...)
    img = DisplayAs.Text(DisplayAs.PNG(img))
    ```

### [Printing tables](@id printing-tables)

Tables that support the [Tables.jl](https://tables.juliadata.org/) interface can be included in the output with the lightweight package [MarkdownTables.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/MarkdownTables.jl).

```julia
using MarkdownTables
table = [(a = 1, b = 2), (a = 3, b = 4)]
table |> markdown_table()
```

### [Adding admonitions using compound line filtering](@id admonitions-md)

Admonitions are a useful feature for drawing attention to particular elements of 
documentation. They are [documented in Documenter.jl]
(https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/showcase/#Basic-Markdown) and
an example of their use can be seen above in the blue 'note' box.
Admonitions is a specific Julia markdown feature, and they are not recognized
by either common mark or Jupyter notebooks. The `md` line filter can be used
to make sure admonitions only show up in markdown output, for example:

```
#md # !!! note "Be aware!"
#md #     This a note style admonition!
```

It is important to note that both `#md` and the second `#` are required. Literate.jl
interprets the first `#md` as a markdown exclusive line, and then strips it out. The 
second `#` tells Literate.jl that the line should be parsed as markdown and not a 
Julia code block. If you only include `#md` and not the second `#` then it will 
be parsed into Julia example block in the final documentation and not an actual 
admonition.


### [Custom parsing for markdown and notebook compatible admonitions](@id admonitions-compatibility)

As mentioned above, admonitions are not compatible with Jupyter notebooks.
(Though at time of writing this documentation,
[this is an open issue in Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1292)
so may change in the future.) For now, we can write a custom preprocessor function
so that admonitions are interpreted as quotes (with their own special formatting)
in notebooks and proper admonitions in markdown. For the case of note admonitions,
this can be written as follows:

```julia
function md_note(str)
    str = replace(str, r"^#note # (.*)$"m => s"""
    # !!! note
    #     \1""")
    return str
end

function nb_note(str)
    str = replace(str, r"^#note # (.*)$"m => s"""
    # > *Note*
    # > \1""")
    return str
end

using Literate

Literate.markdown("example.jl", "tmp/"; preprocess = md_note)

Literate.notebook("example.jl", "tmp/"; preprocess = nb_note)
```

This will allow us to turn the following source code in `example.jl`:

```julia
#note # This is a useful note.
```

into the correct admonition syntax in the markdown file generated:

```julia
!!! note
    This is a useful note.
```

and a quotation style formatting in the generated notebook cell:

```julia
> *Note*
> This is a useful note.
```

which, in an actual notebook cell, will look similar to:

> *Note*\
> This is a useful note.


### [Debugging code execution](@id debug-execution)

When Literate is executing code (i.e. when `execute = true` is set), it does so quietly.
All the output gets captured and nothing gets printed into the terminal.
This can make it tricky to know where things go wrong, e.g. when the execution stalls due
to an infinite loop.

To help debug this, Literate has an `@debug` statement that prints out each code block that
is being executed. In general, to enable the printing of Literate's `@debug` statements, you
can set the `JULIA_DEBUG` environment variable to `"Literate"`.

The easiest way to do that is to set the variable in the Julia session before running
Literate by doing

```julia
ENV["JULIA_DEBUG"]="Literate"
```

Alternatively, you can also set the environment variable before starting the Julia session, e.g.

```sh
$ JULIA_DEBUG=Literate julia
```

or by wrapping the Literate calls in an `withenv` block

```julia
withenv("JULIA_DEBUG" => "Literate") do
    Literate.notebook("myscript.jl"; execute=true)
end
```
